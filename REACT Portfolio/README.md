# Description 

Here is my REACT portfolio app to showcase my new REACT skills. This includes an about me section, portfolio with links to projects, my resume, and a contact form, all built with
REACT. 

# Usage

Run the npm run dev command to see the porfolio in your browser. 

# Future development

I would like to get this styled a lot better. I am still working on the styling. I would also like to add favicons that link to my github and linkedin profiles.
